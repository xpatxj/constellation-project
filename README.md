# Constellation Project

## Description

The Constellation Project is an application for managing a star database. It allows for the addition, removal, and searching of stars based on various criteria such as constellation, distance from Earth, temperature, stellar magnitude, and potential supernovae.

## Features

1. **Adding Stars**: You can add a new star to the database by providing its name, declination, right ascension, observed stellar magnitude, distance from Earth, constellation, hemisphere, temperature, and mass.

2. **Removing Stars**: You can remove a star from the database using its catalog name. All remaining stars in the constellation will have their catalog names updated accordingly.

3. **Searching Stars**: The application provides several search functionalities:
    - Search all stars in a constellation.
    - Search stars within a certain distance from Earth.
    - Search stars within a certain temperature range.
    - Search stars within a certain stellar magnitude range.
    - Search stars in the northern/southern hemisphere.
    - Search potential supernovae.

4. **Data Persistence**: All data is saved in an object file for persistence.
